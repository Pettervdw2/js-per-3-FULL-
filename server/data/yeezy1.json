        "description": "This adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Beluga Reflective (Infants) is building upon the success of the original Beluga colorway, which was first introduced back in September 2016. This version incorporates reflective elements that add a distinctive flair to the shoe. This infant's sneaker features reflective 3M parts that are very visible. The shoe's upper is made of gray Primeknit and has a vivid Solar Red side stripe with contrast SPLY-350 marks. The Three Stripes logos are used on the insoles and sock liner as additional branding. The medial side's suede midfoot panel has been removed, and a new elastic fit has taken its place in place of the pull tab. Full-length BOOST sole components that are enclosed and express a transparent gray tone complete the shoe's appearance. Our experts love this infantâ€™s sneaker upper which features a mix of gray and orange hues with a subtle reflective yarn woven throughout, creating an eye-catching effect when exposed to light. The adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Beluga Reflective (Infants) was released on December 18th, 2021, and retailed at $140.",
